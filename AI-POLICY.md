# Generative AI Usage Policy in gitGost

gitGost maintainers welcome contributions, including those developed with the assistance of generative AI tools. However, the use of such tools does not change our expectations for contributor responsibility, engagement, or code quality. The following applies to all contributions.

## 1. Human Ownership and Accountability

- Contributors are responsible for all submitted content, regardless of whether generative AI tools were used.
- Contributors must be able to explain all changes during review.

## 2. Authentic Engagement

- We expect genuine interaction from people in the community. We do not want issues or comments filled with automatically generated text without real value.
- The pull request process is collaborative and iterative. Contributors are expected to actively engage with reviewer feedback.

## 3. Permitted Use (with conditions)

You can use AI tools **as support** to write code or documentation, but:

- You must **fully understand** the changes.
- You must be able to **explain why they are correct**.
- You must add **your own judgment and added value**.
- You must declare the use of AI in the PR (include an *AI Disclosure* section in the template).

## 4. What is Prohibited

It is **strictly prohibited**:

- Publishing AI-generated content in issues or PRs via automated bots or agents.
- Sending PRs generated solely by AI.
- Using automated accounts that publish contributions without human supervision.

We can:

- Close AI-generated PRs.
- Block users.
- Report them to GitHub if we consider they violate our rules.

## 5. Consistency with gitGost Conventions

- Contributions must be consistent with gitGost's existing conventions and style.
- In the context of generative AI, this particularly means conveying information (comments, documentation, etc.) in a style that the gitGost user community will understand.
