# Security and Vulnerability Reporting

gitGost takes security seriously, particularly given its focus on privacy and anonymity. We welcome responsible vulnerability reports to maintain trust with our users.

## How to Report Vulnerabilities

We accept vulnerability reports responsibly. To protect your anonymity, we provide multiple channels:

### Anonymous Channels
- **Via gitGost itself**: Submit an anonymous PR to this repository reporting the vulnerability (dogfooding).
- **Anonymous Email**: Send an email to `gitGos@proton.me` (preferably encrypted if possible).

### Non-Anonymous Reports
- Open an issue in this repository with the prefix `[SECURITY]` if you prefer public reporting.

## What to Include in the Report
- Clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce it.
- Potential impact.
- Suggested mitigations (optional).

## Response Timeline
- Acknowledgment of receipt within 7 business days.
- Status updates every 7-14 days.
- Resolution of critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

## What NOT to Report via Public Issues
- Do not create public issues for unconfirmed vulnerabilities.
- Avoid discussing exploit details in public.
- Do not use issues for general security inquiries.

## Policies
- No legal action will be taken against good-faith reports.
- Anonymous reports may receive credit if requested (optional).
- We adhere to standards such as [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).
